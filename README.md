Hi, I'm Lena, a passionate front-end developer with a creative twist! With over 4 years of experience crafting responsive, intuitive, and engaging interfaces, I love bringing designs to life through code. My journey spans from working with big retail systems to enhancing e-commerce platforms, all while focusing on clean, efficient, and user-friendly solutions. When I'm not coding, I’m either learning new technologies or spending quality time with my kids, which keeps me energized and inspired. Let’s collaborate and bring some amazing ideas to life!
